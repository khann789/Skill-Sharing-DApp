Project Description
The Peer-to-Peer Skill Sharing dApp is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to exchange skills and services directly with each other using Ether. This platform ensures trustless, transparent, and secure transactions by utilizing smart contracts written in Solidity. It eliminates the need for intermediaries, creating a decentralized marketplace for peer-to-peer interactions.

Objective
The primary objective of this dApp is to build a decentralized, secure, and trustless marketplace for sharing skills and services. The platform allows users to engage in direct transactions, offering transparency, fairness, and eliminating the need for middlemen.

Features
1. Skill Listings
Users can list their services or skills, providing essential details such as a description, price, expiration time, and maximum buyer limit.

Each listing is linked to the provider's wallet address and stored immutably on the blockchain for transparency.

2. Service Purchase
Buyers can purchase services by sending the specified amount of Ether directly to the provider.

The smart contract validates the transaction, ensuring the skill is active, has not expired, and hasn't exceeded the maximum buyer limit.

3. Rating System
After purchasing a service, buyers can rate the service on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Ratings are stored on the blockchain, contributing to the provider’s reputation, fostering trust and transparency.

4. Funds Withdrawal
Service providers can withdraw their earnings securely to their wallets. The smart contract processes the withdrawal and resets the provider’s balance to zero.

5. Skill Deactivation
Skills are automatically deactivated when they reach their expiration date. The deactivation can also be triggered manually, ensuring up-to-date listings.

Additional Features:
Providers can set a maximum number of buyers, ensuring the quality of service.

Buyers can purchase multiple skills in a single transaction for convenience.
